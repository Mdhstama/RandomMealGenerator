**Description**

Website "WhatNih!" is a website-based application as a means for users to get random Indonesian recipes based on islands. Users and Admins can access the website with a browser on a laptop, computer, or gadget. The reason we chose this project is because it is still not developed in Indonesia if you look at the internet.
